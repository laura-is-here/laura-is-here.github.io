                <p>
                    i began developing the web by accident during a meaningless (or so i thought) class on human factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i learned the very basics of html & css as well as important concepts behind accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    years later i am now committed to developing an accessible, safe, free web with a committment to justice and functionality for all people.
