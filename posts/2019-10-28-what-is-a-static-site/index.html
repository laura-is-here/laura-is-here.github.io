                what is a static site?
            </h1>
            <p>at one point in the now vast history of the web, essentially all websites were <em>static</em>&mdash;mostly meaning that they were not <em>dynamic</em>.</p>

<p>to understand this and the implications for us now, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the work that goes on behind the scenes when a user visits a site.</p>

<h2 id="servers-browsers-domains-mdash-oh-my">servers, browsers, domains&mdash;oh my!</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>a site is a collection of pages, usually with a consistent style, grouped together for a particular purpose&mdash;let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;ve made a site for our pet frog, named timothy. we might have a landing page that introduces timothy, which itself contains navigation links to other pages on the site, such as a page for timothy&rsquo;s favorite foods, timothy&rsquo;s hobbies, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>these pages are nothing but text files in html that your browswer can interpret and present nicely</p></li>

<li><p>before your browser can get to the pages, however, it has to know where to get them. this is where domain names come in. you register the domain at <a href="http://myfrogtimothy.me">http://myfrogtimothy.me</a> with a domain registrar, and this domain name server directs traffic where you&rsquo;d like it to</p></li>

<li><p>for our purposes, we want traffic directed to our landing page for timothy, which we store on a server that is able to respond to a browser&rsquo;s request for our files. this server is positioned to understand what the browser is requesting from it</p></li>
</ul>

<p>with static sites, this process is that simple. you type the name of a site into your browser, a domain name server points your browser to the web server where the files for that site are being served, and that server send your browser the requested file for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">the problem</h2>

<p>as sites started getting larger and receiving more traffic, this model of serving static files became harder to manage. enter, dynamic sites.</p>

<p>dynamic sites do more work on what&rsquo;s referred to as <em>the backend</em>&mdash;all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>when your browser requests a page from a dynamic site, the server responds by first putting together pieces, usually from a database or other content management system (cms), and <em>creates</em> the page you asked for then and there.</p>

<p>the implications are that content can remain flexible. make no mistake, dynamic websites have been an important step in the path to the web we all know and love today.</p>

<p>managing website using a database or cms <em>makes sense</em>, especially when many of the same pieces of information are being repeated over and over between different pages.</p>

<p>dynamic sites addressed <em>a problem</em> that web developers needed an answer too.</p>

<p>so, now that we&rsquo;ve come all this way, why static sites again?</p>

<h2 id="the-new-problem-s">the new problem(s)</h2>

<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever set up a wordpress site, you&rsquo;ve set up a dynamic site. congratulations! you&rsquo;ve used databases and a cms to manage and serve up your content.</p>

<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever forgotten to update your wordpress site, or make fine-tuned customizations to the theme, or migrate your content, or faced slow loading times, or&hellip;well, you get the point: dynamic sites consist of so many moving parts that they require <em>maintainence</em> to remain up and running. and often that&rsquo;s skilled maintainence that is time-consuming and costly.</p>

<h2 id="static-sites-to-the-rescue">static sites to the rescue</h2>

<p>modern static sites, and particularly static site generators and build tools, take a different strategy on addressing the problems that dynamic sites were designed to tackle in the first place.</p>

<p>need a database to integrate information into your site?</p>

<p>static sites have you covered with easy to use, plain text database files that generate content for your site at the time it&rsquo;s built (before or during its upload to your server)</p>

<p>running a personal blog to boost your seo?</p>

<p>static sites have you covered with custom cms integration and easy blogging management.</p>

<p>worried about security, maintainence, and all the technical issues that lurk around the corner with your site?</p>

<p>static sites have you covered</p>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">the bottom line</h2>

<p>for many business and organizations, dynamic sites make sense. if there is enough moving content that you&rsquo;d like to present to your users and the resources are there to maintain it and keep users of your site happy, then, by all means, go dynamic!</p>

<p>if you&rsquo;re an individual with an old wordpress site (the kind that has cobwebs piling up on the admin dashboard) that you use to make your presence known online, consider whether or not you actually require the type of service that dynamic sites provide.</p>

<p>small businesses and other organizations would do well to ask themselves these questions as well.</p>
